<div className="feature" role="region" aria-label="Monitoring Expectations Summary">

### What we provide {#monitoring-what-we-provide}

- A way to develop transparency and trust with consumers regarding functionality
- Help and support working through technical barriers and problems
- Issue and downtime alerting for you and your consumers

### What we need from you {#monitoring-what-we-need-from-you}

- A health check endpoint to determine API availability and functionality
- Fast, clear, and responsive communication regarding downtime messaging, updates, and resolution
- Clear, timely communication regarding scheduled downtime

### Key policy highlights {#monitoring-key-policy-highlights}

- You must be willing to publish your availability data on our [API status page](https://valighthouse.statuspage.io/).
- Each API should have a health check endpoint that returns a 200 response if the system is available, a 500 response if it's not available, or no response if the system is entirely down.
- Expected availability times vary depending on the environment and internal/external status.

Developers will grow to distrust APIs that are frequently unavailable or not transparent about availability. We expect APIs to provide a health check endpoint that can be queried to determine if the API is operational. API teams must be willing to have this availability data published on our [API status page](https://valighthouse.statuspage.io/).

At minimum, health checks may stop at the border of the systems implementing the API, but we encourage full adoption of our monitoring policy, which ensures clarity regarding functionality and allows easier identification of problems and issues.

Each API should have a health check endpoint that returns a 200 response if the system is available, and a 500 response if it's not available, or no response if the system is entirely down.

Expected availability varies by environment and whether the API is internal or external.

- In the production environment, the API Gateway has a service level objective of 99.9%. This means it can be unavailable for no more than 8 and 9 hours per year.
- In the sandbox environment, the API Gateway has a service level objective of 99.0%. This means it can be unavailable for no more than 7 and 8 hours per month.
- There is no scheduled maintenance on the API Gateway in either environment, as the API Gateway has zero-downtime deployments.
- Every effort should be made for internal APIs to have 99.9% availability in production and 99.0% availability in the sandbox environment. The Lighthouse team is willing to help work through any technical or policy barriers to achieve this.
