## Use our Health APIs to build tools that help Veterans manage their health, view their VA medical records, and share their information with caregivers and providers. The APIs also provide a Veteran the ability to view their eligibility information that will help them determine if they can receive urgent care and/or community care based on facility proximity and a Veteran’s ability to access care.

VA’s Veteran Health and Urgent Care Eligibility APIs use HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) framework for providing healthcare data in a standardized format. FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "resources". These resources can be easily assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems.

When you register for access to the Health APIs, you will be granted access to a synthetic set of data (provided by the MITRE Corporation) that mimics real Veteran demographics. The associated clinical resources include data generated from disease models covering up to a dozen of the most common Veteran afflictions.
