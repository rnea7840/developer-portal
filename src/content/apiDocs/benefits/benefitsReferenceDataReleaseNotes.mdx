### December, 2021

We added a new API to the developer portal. This API was previously the EVSS Data Reference Service. It allows consumers to look up the following data for use with benefits claims:

- Contention types
- Countries
- Disabilities
- Intake sites
- Military pay types
- Service branches
- Special circumstances
- States
- VA medical treatment facilities

This API will return only the data that can be used for benefits claims. For example, this API may return only a subset of states or countries that apply to benefits claims.

There are some important differences between this API and the service it replaces:

- The new service requires an API key
- There are some stylistic differences such as changes to data types and camelCase
- Responses are in JSON instead of HTML
- For the treatment center endpoint, a 2-character state is required and any other input will now result in a 400 response rather than a 200 response or blank array

Learn more about this API by reviewing the <Link to="/explore/benefits/docs/benefits_reference_data">Benefits Data Lookup API documentation</Link>.
