Release Notes for new Contestable Issues standalone endpoint

We added a new endpoint (`GET /contestable_issues/{decision_review_type}`) to the Decision Reviews API. This endpoint returns contestable issues for a specific Veteran. Using this endpoint lets you tailor your appeal submission flow based on the Veteran’s issues. 

This endpoint returns contestable issues for a single Veteran based on the Veteran’s social security number.
You can search for contestable issues based on these appeal types: higher_level_reviews, notice_of_disagreements, and supplemental_claims. 
The endpoint returns only issues that have been decided as of the receiptDate. 
Read the Decision Review API documentation to learn more.

Decision Reviews API version 2 Release Notes

Version 2 of the Decision Reviews API is now released with the following changes:

We've added a new key, `informalConferenceContact` (required when an informal conference is requested), which will allow us to support both Veteran and representative contacts for informal conferences.
We've updated the possible responses enum of `informalConferenceTime` to reflect the above  changes.
`socOptIn` is now required.
For the representative name, we've split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName` to be more flexible and allow more accurate entries.
The Veteran email field `emailAddressText` has been changed to `email`.

Added hlrCreateAddress to now accept an address for this API. This change follows NOD format:
-`addressLine1`
-`addressLine2`
-`addressLine3`
-`city`
-`stateCode` - enum of all 2-character state codes (see the documentation for more info)
-`countryCodeISO2`
-`zipCode5`
