The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) identifier for each health facility is now available.
- `visn` has been added to all `/facilities` endpoints. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3609)
- For non-health facilities, this will return as `null`.

## November 8, 2019
The `/nearby` endpoint received major changes. 
- Previously, the server retrieved an isochrone (a line connecting points of the same time) for a provided location and looked for facilities that fell within that polygon. Now the opposite is true: facilities have isochrones that are compared against the provided location. Users should see increased performance from this endpoint as a result.
- Data about drive times now comes directly from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Responses may vary slightly from the previous implementation because of this switch.
- The response schema has also changed. Instead of returning facility data from `/nearby`, the endpoint now provides `min_time` and `max_time` attributes for the matching polygons and links to endpoints that can be queried to retrieve full information about the associated facility. This schema change allows us to keep `/nearby` within v0 of the Facilities API instead of incrementing to v1. See the schema changes by [visiting the documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities).

When including latitude and longitude parameters in a request to  `/facilities` the results are now sorted in ascending order by distance.
-  Previously the facilities in the response were sorted by type first and then distance. Now the closest facilities to the requested location will be returned first regardless of type. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3461)

Options for `mobile` are `true` or `false`; options for `active_status` are `A` for Active or `T` for Temporarily deactivated. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3339/commits)
  - Mobile facilities are subject to frequent address changes. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.
