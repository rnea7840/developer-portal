The VA Lighthouse APIs platform uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard to allow Veterans to authorize third-party applications or Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) to access data on their behalf. The kind of access granted, process for authorization, and third party being authorized depends on the API. 

The first step toward authorization is to <Link to="/apply">fill out our application</Link> and make sure to select the right OAuth API for your needs. To complete the form, you will need: 
- Your organization name
- To know which OAuth APIs you want to access
- To know whether your app can securely hide a client secret
- Your OAuth redirect URI

After you submit the form, we send you a client ID and secret, depending on whether you can safely store a client secret. If you cannot safely store a client secret, we will send you a client ID and you will use the <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#pkce-authorization' }}>Proof Key for Code Exchange</HashLink> (PKCE) flow ([RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) for authorization.
