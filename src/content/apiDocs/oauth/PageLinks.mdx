### It’s also good to know that: 
- The access credentials we supply are for the sandbox environment only and will not work in the production environment. 
- This page provides examples that show authorization server URLs in the sandbox environment, which differ depending on the API. 
- When your application is ready, you may <Link to="/go-live">apply for production access</Link>.
