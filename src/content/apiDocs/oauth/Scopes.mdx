<SectionHeaderWrapper heading="Scopes" id="scopes" />

Scopes define the API endpoint your application is allowed to access. We suggest requesting the fewest number of scopes for which you require a Veteran to provide consent. You can always request access to additional scopes if a Veteran or VSO needs the data while using your application.  

**Existing Scopes are:**
| Scope            | Values and description |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `profile`        | Granted by default, allows access to a user's first and last name and email. |
| `offline_access` | This scope causes the authorization server to provide a refresh token when the <HashLink to={{ ...location, hash: '#id-token' }}>access token</HashLink> is requested. |
| `openid`         | An `id_token` is available in the authorization code flow (response_type = code) token response when the 'openid' scope is used. |
