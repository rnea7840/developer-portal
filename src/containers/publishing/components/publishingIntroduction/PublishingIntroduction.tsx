      <strong>
        VA Lighthouse APIs work with internal VA teams to publish the APIs they’ve created.
      </strong>{' '}
      Together, Lighthouse and VA are driving innovation to help Veterans control their data and
      access the benefits they’ve earned. If you are an internal VA team and want to publish your
      API to help further the goals of the Office of Information and Technology{' '}
      <a href="https://www.oit.va.gov/reports/year-in-review/2020/">
        digital transformation strategy
      </a>
      , you’re in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Publishing your API on Lighthouse results in a streamlined API experience for you and your
      consumers. Our vision is to create the most reliable and usable API program in government to
      enable innovation and fast integration. Simplify your API management and help us achieve our
      goals by publishing your API on the Lighthouse developer portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We publish only modern, <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">RESTful</a> APIs, but if your API
      follows another protocol and you’re interested in publishing your API on our platform, reach
      out to us. We may be able to help you convert your API so you can benefit from being part of
      the Lighthouse community.
    </p>

          We help your API documentation conform to our documentation standards, improving usability
          and ensuring human readability. We handle versioning in a clear and visible way, meaning

        <p>
          Partners can use tools such as sample requests to quickly allow their application to
          consume your API. Our sandbox environment is self-service, making it easy for partners to
          quickly (and automatically!) gain access and see responses and functionality in real-time.
